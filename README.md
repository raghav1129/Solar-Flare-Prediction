# Solar-Flare-Prediction
This study is a comparison on the performance of various ensemble based and deep learning models on their ability to classify sunspots as flaring or non-flaring sunspots with those of traditional machine learning methods. A sunspot is dark region on the surface of the sun which appears dark because it is cooler than the rest of the surface due to the presence of high magnetic field within that region. A solar flare is a sudden and short-lived burst of energy from these spots which can have major effects on the space weather and can also cause major effects on earth. The study explores two datasets, sunspots and solar flares which were gathered from the publicly available catalogue from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).<br/>

A study on the correlation on the magnetic and morphological properties of the sunspots conducted to understand what properites constitute towards a flaring sunspot and classification models are developed accordingly.<br/>

Most of the work is based on the works of: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233400099_Automatic_Short-Term_Solar_Flare_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning_and_Sunspot_Associations, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226879084_Automated_Prediction_of_Solar_Flares_Using_Neural_Networks_and_Sunspots_Associations<br/>
